            <li>2 ounces shredded mozzarella cheese</li>

        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 10-inch pie plate or springform pan.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Stir in 1 tablespoon oil and 2 teaspoons salt. 
                Cook spaghetti in boiling water-oil mixture, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 
                about 12 minutes. Drain, then transfer to a large bowl.
            </li>
            <li>
                Mix eggs, Parmesan cheese, and butter into spaghetti until well combined. 
                Press and shape into the prepared pie plate to form crust. Spread cottage cheese over crust.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. 
                Cook and stir beef, onion, and green pepper until beef is thoroughly browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. 
                Mix in tomatoes, tomato paste, sugar, oregano, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and garlic powder until combined. 
                Spread mixture over cottage cheese.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake uncovered in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. 
                Sprinkle with mozzarella cheese and continue baking until cheese is bubbly and beginning to brown, 5 to 10 minutes more.
            </li>
        </ol>
